# Future development 

- Add a difficulty system (beginner: basic characters only, intermediate: includes diacritics, advanced: includes combinations). Combinations should be short words consisting of 2-3 characters. They should be real words with meanings. The word meanings should also be shown on the back of the flashcards.
- Implement a spaced repetition algorithm to optimize learning. Track user performance on each character and adjust the frequency of reviews accordingly.
- Introduce audio pronunciation for each character to aid auditory learning.
- Create a quiz mode where users can test their knowledge with multiple-choice questions or fill-in-the-blank exercises.
- Allow users to track their progress over time with statistics and performance graphs.
- Make the app customizable with themes (light/dark mode) and font size adjustments.
- Expand the app to include other Japanese scripts like Kanji in future updates.
- Consider adding support for multiple languages for the UI text, allowing users to choose their preferred language
- Users should be able to add a custom list of strings to practice, e.g., common words or phrases in Japanese using Kana characters, or even their own vocabulary lists.
- Implement user authentication to save progress across devices.
- Optimize the app for offline use by caching data and assets.
- Explore the possibility of turning the app into a Progressive Web App (PWA) for better mobile experience.
- When adding custom strings, provide both sides of the flashcards as input.
- Add a feature to review only the characters that the user struggles with the most.
- The user should be able to add more custom lists without overwriting previous ones.
- Translate the app into English
- Add a feature to allow users to edit or delete their custom lists.
